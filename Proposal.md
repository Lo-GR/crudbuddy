Name of Student: Logan Roth

Name of Project: CRUDBuddy ( Working Title)

Project's Purpose or Goal: 

Able to put name of objects, queries, and other aspects of CRUD and have the web application return a full C#/.NET CRUD API that can be copied and pasted. 

User Stories: 
- As a user I want to be able to enter the name of the object I wish to make full CRUD C#/.NET/Sql of (example, National Parks). 
- As a user I wish to then receive the entire, written out code of the object that I can either export or copy and paste into a Model and Controller cs file. Saving time of needing to manually type out 
- As a user I wish to modify the CRUD generated with options such as queries.
_Stretch_
- As a user, I wish to sign up and save the CRUD I generated to retrieve later.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- A form to enter CRUD information users want to generate
- A fully hosted and functional webpage
- Return Full Basic CRUD for object users want to generate

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- React/Redux for majority of website design
- Firebase for hosting
- C#/.NET knowledge in order to create the generation template

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Full CRUD for other languages or frameworks
- The ability to export actual cs files containing the code.
- I hope to add some "fun flare" to the website outside of just CRUD. Will determine what at a later point.
- User signups to save the crud generated.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Firebase/store authentication and authorization
- Depending on how many languages are supported, will likely need further research into how their APIs or server side CRUD is made
- The Fun Flare is really a wild card. I'll be focused on getting the other resources first than doing further research.
- Need to research how to export files for download. 

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

- This might seem hard to visualize right now but once I get far enough in it'll be clear what I'm attempting.
- My overall goal is to show off my skills on front end by designing a quality site to use and show off my backend knowledge by showing I'm familiar enough with backend to create a generator for it.
